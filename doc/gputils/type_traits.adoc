[#type_traits]
= <type_traits> support
:idprefix: type_traits_

When programming with CUDA platforms you can not directly use the normal `<type_traits>` header,
as it provides similar functionality in `<cuda/std/type_traits>`.
Here we provide an alias that allows both of the type_traits to be used seamlessly between platforms.
We also provide C++17 overloads such as `is_same_v` for pure convinence.
See also: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/type_traits for an exhaustave list and proper documentation.
